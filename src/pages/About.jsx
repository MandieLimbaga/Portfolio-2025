                 full-stack web developer. I’m passionate about acquiring new
                 skills and growing in both front-end and back-end development.
                 I'm currently proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL,
                 and Java, and I'm diving into React to expand my front-end toolkit. Outside of web development, I’m also studying penetration testing to deepen my understanding of web security and ethical hacking. Always curious, always coding!</p>
